The objective of this embedded systems programming project is to utilize a PS Eye camera to capture photographs when motion is detected, which are then sent to a bot on the Telegram messaging application. The embedded system, comprising a Raspberry Pi 4 and the camera, is responsible for performing the image capture process and transmitting the data to the bot, making remote monitoring possible via Telegram.
To implement this solution, it is necessary to develop a control program that interfaces with the PS Eye camera and captures images when motion is detected. This program must also be capable of establishing a connection with the Telegram bot to send the captured images in real-time.
